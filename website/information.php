            <p>You can find truckers all over the world. They care with lotâ€™s of hard work for the transport of products. DAF thinks this hard workers should be rewarded with some real relaxing -after and when they work. This explains the DAF Road Experience. 
<br><br>
DAF drives through Europe to care for this relaxing breaks. On different truckstops we locate our pop-up truck with different relax-opportunities.  From darting in our dart-corner with a nice cold drink to intensive training in the fitness-truck. Relaxing and sociability are our highest priority!
<br><br>
Know where to find us! We got an online map where you can see the current location of our truck. And uhh, not unimportant to say: Every form of participation is free!</p>
